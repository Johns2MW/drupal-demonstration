The following are additional steps required, and cannot be automated via puppet:

I. Varnish
  a. Once varnish module has been enabled, add the following to 'settings.php':

```php
...
  // Add Varnish as a cache bin.
    $conf['cache_backends'][] = 'sites/all/modules/varnish/varnish.cache.inc';

  // implement 'expire' module, be selective with what to cache / expire
    //$conf['cache_class_external_varnish_page'] = 'VarnishCache';

  // do not implement 'expire' module, not selective with expiration
    $conf['cache_class_cache_page'] = 'VarnishCache';
...
```

* Go to admin/config/development/varnish and configure your connection Varnish
  appropriately. It should be pretty straight forward from here on.
